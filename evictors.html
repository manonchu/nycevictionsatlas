       <h2> ABOUT THIS MAP </h2>
      There were <strong><span class="evictions">18,007 residential evictions carried out by Marshals </span></strong> in New York City in 2018. Let that number sit for a minute. If you have ever sat in court with a loved one fighting an eviction or heard from an elder who is being displaced from their long-time neighborhood, you know that every single one of those 18,007 evictions had a devastating impact on someone’s life. Despite the sheer enormity of this number, tenants are often blamed for their own evictions, for falling behind on rent or for being “bad tenants” who don’t fit into the system. Yet, when you witness the scale of the eviction crisis in NYC, you know something is up. This is not an individual problem, but the very way the housing system is set up to work. <br/>

     <br> This data does not even tell the whole story: this is only the number of evictions that were physically carried out by Marshals. When served with an eviction notice, many tenants move out of their apartments before their landlord hires a Marshal to forcefully evict them. 
      Often, landlords file bogus eviction cases over and over again as an intimidation tactics to displace tenants and replace them with higher-paying residents. 
      Despite pressure from advocates, the City has yet to release up-to-date data about eviction filings, which would reveal how evictions are used as a harrassment tactic. 
      Thankfully, thanks to the Right to Counsel legislation which provides free legal representation to tenants facing eviction cases, more and more tenants are able to fight back in housing court and win their eviction cases. <br/> 

      <br> We believe in documenting the housing crisis to shift the narrative on evictions and changing policy to shift power from the hands of landlords to tenants and communities. Evictions are violent, and we will not be silent! <br/>
